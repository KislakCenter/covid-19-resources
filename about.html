    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>All Penn Libraries locations, including Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center, are closed until further notice. All events scheduled to take place in Libraries spaces have been cancelled. This site provides a list of digital resources from Kislak Center for Special Collections, the Library at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts, and the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to all physical materials has been suspended until further notice. Given current restrictions on staff access to Libraries locations and offsite storage, we’re unable to provide any access to our physical collections. We’re not able to Scan and Deliver texts or mail physical copies of books at this time. As most of our partner libraries are likewise closed, many interlibrary loan activities, including Borrow Direct and E-ZBorrow, have been suspended.</li>
      <li>All access to special and non-circulating physical collections has been suspended. This includes access to items held by the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.</li>
