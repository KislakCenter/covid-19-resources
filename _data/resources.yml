  description: |
    The SDBM continuously aggregates and updates observations of pre-modern manuscripts drawn from over 13,000 auction and sales catalogs, inventories, catalogs from institutional and private collections, and other sources that document their sales and locations from around the world. This is an interactive resource for finding, indexing, and researching the world's manuscripts. Members of its user community can become contributing partners in its development by adding new entries, commenting on other users entries, aggregating entries to create “manuscript records,” and helping to build an authority file of persons and institutions associated with the movement of manuscripts across time and place.

  description: 'The Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica documents an astonishingly broad range of commercial, social, religious, political, and cultural ties that connected Jews and the general public from the early colonial era through the onset of mass migration at the end of the nineteenth century. The collection includes records of everyday lives, families, businesses, communal institutions, religious organizations, voluntary associations, and political circumstances of Jewish life. It provides a unique window into the changing character of colonial life and culture around the Atlantic world and within the United States and it documents changing perceptions and experiences of new worlds of space and time, not only from the perspective of its Jewish colonists and citizens but also in the context of the larger societies in which they have lived.'

  description: |
    Manuscript Studies is a new journal that embraces the full complexity of global manuscript studies in the digital age, with full text content available through Project MUSE. It has been conceived with four main goals in mind. First, to bridge the gaps between material and digital manuscript research; second, to break down the walls which often separate print and digital publication and serve as barriers between academics, professionals in the cultural heritage field, and citizen scholars; third, to serve as a forum for scholarship encompassing many pre-modern manuscripts cultures—not just those of Europe; and finally to showcase methods and techniques of analysis in manuscript studies that can be applied across different subject areas.

It consists of a data model for modeling of a manuscript (based on quires, leaves in quires, and typology for the leaves (original, missing, added, replaced)), software for building models in a tabular format (published online and expressed in a custom XML schema), and software for generating visualizations from that model, via another online form. VisColl is free and available for anyone to use.

    These videos celebrate the physicality of manuscripts that traditional manuscript digitization projects cannot capture. While digitization focuses on page images, and sometimes on text encoding, these videos feature scholars discussing what is special (or typical, or otherwise interesting) about manuscripts, providing an intimate view not only of the textual content of the manuscripts, but also their physical context.
