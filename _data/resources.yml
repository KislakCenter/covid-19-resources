    The SDBM continuously aggregates and updates observations of pre-modern manuscripts drawn from over 13,000 auction and sales catalogs, inventories, catalogs from institutional and private collections, and other sources that document their sales and locations from around the world. This is an interactive resource for finding, indexing, and researching the world's manuscripts. Members of its user community can become contributing partners in its development by adding new entries, commenting on other users entries, aggregating entries to create “manuscript records,” and helping to build an authority file of persons and institutions associated with the movement of manuscripts across time and place.

    Manuscript Studies is a new journal that embraces the full complexity of global manuscript studies in the digital age, with full text content available through Project MUSE.

First, to bridge the gaps between material and digital manuscript research; second, to break down the walls which often separate print and digital publication and serve as barriers between academics, professionals in the cultural heritage field, and citizen scholars; third, to serve as a forum for scholarship encompassing many pre-modern manuscripts cultures—not just those of Europe; and finally to showcase methods and techniques of analysis in manuscript studies that can be applied across different subject areas.
